    "The code scrapes property data from the website \"99acres.com\" for apartments in Gurgaon. It navigates through a range of pages, extracts details of each property, and saves the data to a CSV file. The script is designed to handle potential errors gracefully, using try and except blocks to manage missing data, and introduces pauses to avoid making rapid requests and potentially getting blocked by the website.\n",

    "- **Initialization of Variables**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - start and end specify the range of web pages to scrape.\n",
    "    - csv_file defines the path to the CSV file where data will be saved.\n",
    "    - pageNumber starts from the initial value of start and will be incremented to navigate through the pages.\n",
    "    - req counts the number of HTTP requests made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loop for Page Navigation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The while loop is used to navigate through each page in the range from start to end.\n",
    "    - Inside this loop, the URL of the page to be scraped is constructed using the pageNumber.\n",
    "    - An HTTP GET request is made to retrieve the content of the page, and the content is then parsed using BeautifulSoup.\n",

    "- **Loop for Property Extraction**:\n",

    "    - The nested for loop navigates through individual property sections on the current page.\n",

    "    - If any of these attributes are missing, it skips to the next property.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Detail Extraction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For each property, an HTTP request is made to its detail page.\n",
    "    - The code then attempts to extract various property details like price, area, bedroom count, bathroom count, balcony count, address, and many other attributes. If any attribute is missing, the code handles it gracefully, assigning an empty string or an empty list as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating and Saving Data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - All extracted details are stored in a dictionary named property_data.\n",
    "    - This dictionary is then converted to a temporary DataFrame temp_df.\n",
    "    - The data is appended to a main DataFrame flats and also saved to the CSV file. If the file already exists, the new data is appended without writing the headers again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Request Management**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To avoid making too many rapid requests (which can lead to IP bans), the script introduces pauses.\n",
    "    - Every 4 requests, it pauses for 10 seconds. Every 15 requests, it pauses for 50 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Page Counter and Loop Increment**:\n",

    "    - After scraping all properties on a page, the code prints the page number and the number of properties processed.\n",
